# Arhitecture

At a high level, Kubernetes has the following main components:

- Master nodes
- Worked nodes
- Distributed key-value stor, like **etcd**

# Master nodes

Master node is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster, and it is the entry point for all administrative tasks. We can communicate to the master node via the CLI, the GUI (Dashboard), or via APIs.
